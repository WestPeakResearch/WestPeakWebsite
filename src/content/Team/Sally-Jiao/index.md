Sally is in her fourth year studying finance and minoring in math. She joined WestPeak in first year as a junior analyst and loved the research and people so much that she decided to come back for the next two years! Sally finds the capital markets fascinating because of its complexity and unpredictability. She previously worked at a local consulting firm and on the public equities team at the Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan, and she would love to pursue a future career in either quantitative investing or in governmental/academic economic research.

Outside of academia, Sally loves painting, creative writing, trying new recipes, and teaching (if you're in Math 104 or Comm 295 come say hi in office hours!)
