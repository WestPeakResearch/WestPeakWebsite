Sally is a third year commerce student with an intended specialization in finance and minor in economics. She is inspired by the chaotic nature of finance, because she enjoys organizing it and shaping it into something presentable. Sally knows that the future of business is unpredictable, but she looks forward to finding solutions that will combat the unprecedented changes. Sally is excited to gain and apply her knowledge to a career in either financial analysis or investment banking.

Outside of school, she enjoys acrylic painting and writing free-verse poetry.
