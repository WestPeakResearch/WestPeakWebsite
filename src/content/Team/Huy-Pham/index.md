Huy is a third-year commerce student with an intended double specialization in Finance and Entrepreneurship. The capital markets fascinates him for how interdisciplinary it is with interaction between businesses, government, the economy, etc. For equity research specifically, he loves the way it provides a comprehensive overview of a business from internal operation to external strategy. Therefore, opportunities to learn and explore in this field are endless and Huy is sure up for it!

Aside from academics and work, Huy enjoys reading, hanging out with friends and playing sports e.g intramural soccer and bricking threes in the SRC.
