Sunny is a second-year commerce student intending to specialize in Finance. Her interest in the capital markets is driven by its dynamic nature and underlying behavioural implications. She has had the privilege of learning about starting and running a company through the Junior Achievement Company Program and has been able to participate in many events to learn more about the various careers available in the industry. 

In her free time, Sunny loves to draw, read all kinds of books and write unnecessarily long reviews for them.
