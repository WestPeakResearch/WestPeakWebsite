Colin is a second-year commerce student specializing in finance. He recently joined WestPeak, and is excited to explore his avid interest in the capital markets by learning more about financial modelling, business valuation, and equity research. This summer, Colin is looking for a summer internship, where he can apply his learnings from WestPeak!

Outside of school, Colin can be found playing basketball, weightlifting, running, trying local restaurants, watching new movies, and spending time with his family and friends. 

Heâ€™s excited to contribute to the WestPeak team and learn from the great mentors in the club!
