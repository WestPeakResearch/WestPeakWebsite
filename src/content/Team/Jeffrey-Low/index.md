Jeffrey is a first year commerce student who intends to specialize in finance. The summer before entering UBC, he worked as an analyst for Growth Advising, where he was first introduced to finance and worked alongside a team to create stock pitches. Still curious about the rapidly evolving and interconnected nature of finance, he hopes to further explore capital markets during university.

In his spare time, Jeffrey enjoys participating in half-marathon races, experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen, watching science-fiction movies, and following the latest news in the fashion industry.
