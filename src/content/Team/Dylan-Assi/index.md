Dylan is a second-year commerce student with an intended specialization in Finance and a concentration in Business Analytics. He joined WestPeak to develop his entrepreneurial mindset and passion for the capital markets that sparked from learning of the potential for finance to “ethically fulfill the 
future.” 

He aims to cultivate a skillset of capital markets concepts, building upon experience in foundational financial modelling and his conceptual mobile app- Synergy, an M&A toolkit optimized for FinTech startups. 

Outside of the classroom, Dylan can be found exploring coffee shops, skiing in the Kootenay’s, and cheering on the Pittsburgh Steelers.
