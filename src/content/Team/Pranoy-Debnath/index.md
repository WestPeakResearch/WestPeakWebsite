Pranoy is a second year commerce student looking to specialize in Finance. His initial interest in the capital markets was sparked by simply being curious about how his family could maximize their returns with regards to their private finances. He hopes to use his time at WestPeak as a significant step towards gaining greater knowledge and confidence with regards to company valuation techniques.

Outside of finance, he enjoys tennis, football, crying to Bojack Horseman, and playing guitar in his indie band “Pacific City Limits.”
