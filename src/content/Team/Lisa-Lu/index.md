Lisa is a third-year commerce student specializing in Finance. She joined WestPeak in her second year to extend her curiosity of the capital markets and to join a group of like-minded and driven individuals. She looks forward to developing a more comprehensive understanding of how macroenvironmental factors affect the markets, and to develop deeper analytical skills that can be applied to everyday life. This past summer, she interned at Commodity Partners as a Research Analyst, and this coming summer she will be in Toronto on the BMO Investment Banking Team.

Outside of school, Lisa loves hiking, skiing, and paddle boarding. She also drinks lots of yerba mate and recently picked up pottery.
