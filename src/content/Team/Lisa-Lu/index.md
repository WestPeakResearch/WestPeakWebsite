Lisa is a second year commerce student hoping to specialize in finance and concentrate in sustainability and social impact. She joined WestPeak to extend her curiosity of the capital markets and to join a group of like-minded and driven individuals. She looks forward to developing a more comprehensive understanding of how macroenvironmental factors affect the markets, and to develop deeper analytical skills that can be applied to everyday life. This past summer, she interned at a non-profit and hopes to continue making a meaningful impact through her work.

Outside of school, Lisa loves hiking, skiing, and paddle boarding. She is also a Guayaki ambassador and drinks a lot of yerba mate.
