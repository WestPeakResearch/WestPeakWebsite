Benjamin is a third-year commerce student specializing in finance. Through WestPeak, he has explored his avid interest in the capital markets by learning more about financial modelling, business valuation, and equity research. This past summer, Benjamin completed an internship with Jarislowsky Fraser's equity research team in Toronto, where he got to apply his learnings from WestPeak!

Outside of school, Benjamin can be found playing soccer, trying local restaurants, reading new books, and talking to his family and friends. He is a die-hard Arsenal fan and loves Thai food.
