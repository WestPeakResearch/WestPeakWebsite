Benjamin is a fourth-year commerce student specializing in finance. Through WestPeak, he has explored his avid interest in the capital markets by learning more about financial modelling, business valuation, and equity research. He also found his community and best friends at WestPeak, bonding over finance, soccer, and food. This summer, Benjamin is interning at BlackRock in New York, where he got to apply his learnings from WestPeak!

Outside of school, Benjamin can be found playing soccer, trying local restaurants, reading new books, and talking to his family and friends. He is a die-hard Arsenal fan and loves Thai food. 

WestPeak has played a crucial role in his undergrad and he is excited to give back to the community and help advance the UBC presence in finance!
