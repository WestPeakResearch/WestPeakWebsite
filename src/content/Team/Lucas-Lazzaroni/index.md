Lucas is a third-year BCom student specializing in finance. Through WestPeak, Lucas hopes to make likeminded friends and gain the knowledge and skills needed for a career in the capital markets.

In his spare time, Lucas enjoys watching any and every movie, arranging for the piano, and marathon running (the term “enjoys” is used loosely for the latter).
