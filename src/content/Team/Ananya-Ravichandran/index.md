I am a fourth-year majoring in the Bachelor of International Economics. This past summer, I worked at CIBC's Investment Banking team in Vancouver. Over the 4 months, I worked as a part of the Metal & Mining and Diversified teams. I am also an Analyst in the SWIFT Program. Next summer, I will be working in CIBC's EIT team in Calgary.

In my free time, I like playing basketball, snowboarding and surfing.
