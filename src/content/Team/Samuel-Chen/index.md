Samuel is a second-year commerce student with an intended specialization in Finance and minor in Economics. His interest in the capital markets derives from its pervasive integration within society and its potential as a vehicle for social change. As a member of WestPeak, Samuel hopes to learn about how various vicissitudes impact global markets and how to best synergize information when valuing a company.

Outside of the classroom, Samuel can be found trying out new restaurants, playing basketball in the SRC, or listening to the latest Malcolm Gladwell podcast.
