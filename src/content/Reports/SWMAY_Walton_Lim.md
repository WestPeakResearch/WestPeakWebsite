summary: "Swedish Match AB (Swedish Match) is a vertically integrated tobacco products, matches, and lighters
company based in Stockholm, Sweden. Swedish Match’s production facilities are located in six countries
and its largest markets are Scandinavia (Norway, Denmark, and Sweden), the United States, and Brazil.
The three main product divisions are described as “snus and moist snuff products,” “other tobacco
products,” which are cigars and chewing tobacco, and “lights” which are matches and lighters. Snus and
moist snuff products are the dominant contributors by a measure of sales and operating profit. Swedish
snus is a unique product in the smokeless tobacco market. Snus (Swedish IPA: “snʉːs”), is a finely ground
and unfermented tobacco product that is water pasteurized, packaged in small cellulose pouches (or
kept loose), and sold in circular containers."
