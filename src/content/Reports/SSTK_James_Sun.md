summary: "We believe Shutterstock’s last three disappointing quarters are not
indicative of its future growth prospects, and we remain optimistic about the
transition to a broader and more creative platform as one that will
accelerate revenue growth and expand margins through a successful
expansion into adjacent markets. We believe the market and most brokers
are not fully appreciating Shutterstock’s current transition, and are valuing it
purely as a stock photo repository."
