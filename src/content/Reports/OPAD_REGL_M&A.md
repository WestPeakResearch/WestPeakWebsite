date: "2021-12-07"
summary: "As the largest player in the iBuying ('instant' buying) market, Opendoor benefits from strong residential real estate growth and its lead competitor, Zillow’s, failure. With the proposed acquisition of Offerpad, Opendoor benefits on key strengths and gains greater market data access, an expanded portfolio, and operational efficiencies across both established and new markets. Furthermore, an acquisition would convert a growing rival into a key asset and solidify Opendoor’s position as an iBuying leader."
