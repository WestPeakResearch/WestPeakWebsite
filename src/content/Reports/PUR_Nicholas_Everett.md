summary: "Pure is a Canadian firm which develops technologies for the global markets of water, wastewater, oil
and gas pipeline infrastructure, bridges, and other structures. Pure utilizes its technology pool, in
tandem with proprietary software developments for the purpose of inspecting, monitoring, and

managing infrastructure. The value in Pure’s business model is derived from the cost-savings of risk-
averse infrastructure management – enabling municipalities and other clients to detect and remedy any

future leaks, or potential breaks in their respective property before they occur. Traditional pipeline
management methods are reactive, replacing pipe sections due primarily to age, or after a break has
already occurred. Realistically, for any explanation other than general wear and tear, there only exists a
correlation between age and pipeline integrity; damage is instead caused by pressure, above ground
activity, ground conditions (acidity, soil contents), weather, and installation issues. Pure highlights that
only 4% of water and wastewater pipe sections are in a distressed state, and that less that 1% of those
sections require any immediate repair efforts. The consequences of pipe breaks are also significant. If,
for example, a municipality were to face a water pipe burst, they risk the service interruption from
compromised water quality, and subsequent flooding. Pure has successfully moved its tech offerings
into the larger municipal markets of North American water and wastewater. The next stage of Pure’s
strategy is to move their business into newer markets, spanning different pipe materials, smaller
municipalities, and oil & gas pipelines"
