When we realized how few opportunities there were for students to apply their academic learning and be recognized for their talent, we took it upon ourselves to change the situation. WestPeak Research Association was started in the hopes of bridging the gap between the classroom and the workplace. Through peer mentorship and professional seminars, we seek to prepare our members with the necessary skills required for success in the capital markets industry.

Our team is composed of students from different academic backgrounds. The only common traits we look for are interest, integrity, and curiosity. Passion for a career in the capital markets industry often manifests itself in a variety of ways - our members often refer to a "spark" which first drew their attention. WestPeak is here to cultivate that spark and provide an environment of like minded individuals who seek to grow together.

WestPeak was founded on September 1, 2014 and became incorporated under the British Columbia Society Act on October 23, 2014.
