## PLEASE READ THIS PAGE CAREFULLY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS YOU MAY NOT USE AND MUST CEASE USING THIS WEBSITE.

#### IMPORTANT SECURITIES DISCLAIMER

No content published on the Website constitutes a recommendation that any particular security, portfolio of securities, transaction or investment strategy is suitable for any specific person. WestPeak, its directors, analysts, and affiliates are not advising you personally concerning the nature, potential, value or suitability of any particular security, portfolio of securities, transaction, investment strategy or other matter. To the extent that any of the content published on the Website may be deemed to be investment advice or recommendations in connection with a particular security, such information is impersonal and not tailored to the investment needs of any specific person. By using this Website, you understand that WestPeak, its directors, analysts, and affiliates are not licensed to provide investment advice.

An investment in any security is subject to a number of risks, and discussions of any security published on the Website will not contain a list or description of relevant risk factors. In addition, please note that some of the stocks about which content is published on the Website may have a low market capitalization and/or insufficient public float. Such stocks are subject to more risk than stocks of larger companies, including greater volatility, lower liquidity and less publicly available information. Postings or content on the Website which may or may not be deemed by you to be recommendations may have an effect on their stock prices.

This Website may contain opinions from time to time with regard to securities mentioned in other WestPeak research reports or postings, and the opinions in one report or posting may be different from those in another report or posting. However, you understand and agree that at the time of any transaction that you make, WestPeak, its directors, analysts, or affiliates may have a position in the securities written about or in any securities related to or based on securities written about on this Website. You understand that performance data is supplied by sources believed to be reliable, that the calculations herein are made using such data, and that such calculations are not guaranteed by these sources, the information providers, or any other person or entity, and may not be complete.

From time to time, reference may be made on this Website to prior articles and opinions published on this Website. These references may be selective, may reference only a portion of an article or opinion, and are likely not to be current. As markets change continuously, previously published information and data may not be current and should not be relied upon.

All content on the Website is presented only as of the date published or indicated, and may be superseded by subsequent market events or for other reasons. In addition, you are responsible for setting the cache settings on your browser to ensure you are receiving the most recent data.

#### NO INVESTMENT RECOMMENDATIONS OR PROFESSIONAL ADVICE

The Website is not intended to provide tax, legal, insurance or investment advice, and nothing on the Website should be construed as an offer to sell, a solicitation of an offer to buy, or a recommendation for any security by WestPeak, its directors, analysts, or affiliates or any third party. You alone are solely responsible for determining whether any investment, security or strategy, or any other product or service, is appropriate or suitable for you based on your investment objectives and personal and financial situation. You should consult an attorney or tax professional regarding your specific legal or tax situation.

WEBSITE PRIVACY STATEMENT

​

WestPeak Research Association has developed this website (the “Website”) as an electronic resource with information about our organization and its programs.

We are committed to providing our visitors with a website that respects their privacy. This page summarizes the privacy practices on our Website. We reserve the right to change this privacy statement at any time.

By using this Website, you signify your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this statement.

During a visit to our Website, we do not collect personal information that identifies you as an individual, such as your name and contact information, unless you supply it voluntarily.

INFORMATION AUTOMATICALLY COLLECTED

Non‑identifying Information – Like many other organizations’ websites, ours automatically collects certain non‑identifying information regarding website users, such as the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your computer, the IP address of your Internet Service Provider, the date and time you access our Website, the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our Website, the operating system you are using, and pages of our Website you visit. This non‑identifying information is used for our Website and system administration purposes and to improve the Website. Your non‑identifying information may be used and permanently archived for future use in order to facilitate your online experience and to gather broad demographic information.

We make no attempt to link this information with the identity of individuals visiting our Website. We may, however, review server logs for security purposes, for example to detect intrusions into our network. The possibility therefore exists that server log data, which contains visitors’ IP addresses, could in instances of criminal malfeasance be used to trace and identify individuals. In such instances, raw data logs would be shared with appropriate investigative bodies authorized to investigate such breaches of security.

Cookies – Our Website uses “cookies”, a technology that installs information on a website user’s computer to permit the website to recognize future visits using that computer. Cookies enhance the convenience and use of a website. You may choose to decline cookies if your browser permits, but doing so may affect your use of our Website and your ability to access certain features of our Website.
