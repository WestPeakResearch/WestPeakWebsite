In the past, our most successful analysts have been those with unwavering curiosity and eagerness to explore topics related to financial markets. Students with an interest in pursuing a career in the capital markets industry are encouraged to apply.

You will have access to exclusive training modules and resources designed to help you learn finance concepts and develop skills needed within the capital markets. Through your deliverables, you will gain valuable research, analytical, and financial modelling skills. In addition to the learning, you will also gain access to mentors and networking sessions held with industry professionals and alumni working in investment banking, sales and trading, asset management, wealth management, and more.


### OVERVIEW OF JUNIOR AND SENIOR PROGRAM

This year, we are expanding our program to include a structured program for both Juniors and Seniors. Historically, we have only run the Junior Analyst program, which taught members the capital markets fundamentals and how to write an equity research report. Recognizing that there are students with more extensive prior experience in finance, we developed the Senior Analyst program to allow those to take an in-depth approach and specialize in a specific industry.
